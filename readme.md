Schizo diversifies your JS coding style by applying a random coding standard across your code. Not a true obfuscator, Shizo leaves code readable, if rended in an unexpected form. Schizo is a coding anti-style.

Schizo'd code:
- uses sometimes tabs, sometimes spaces
- uses standard JS indent style or one of the others https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style
- single-quote or double-quote
- semi-colons required or not
