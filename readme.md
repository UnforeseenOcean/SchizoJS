Schizo diversifies your JS coding style by applying a random coding standard. Schizo is a coding anti-style. Best used if re-run with each revision of your code.


Schizo'd code:
- uses sometimes tabs, sometimes spaces
- uses standard JS indent style or one of the others https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style
- single-quote or double-quote
- semi-colons required or not
